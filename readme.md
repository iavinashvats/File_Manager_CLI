# Simple File Manager CLI In Node.js

    - While Learning Node.js Basics I try to make a file structure or file manager in Node.js 
    - Learning basic nitty-gritty of Node.js like:- fs, http, streams, process & more!

## 📁 File manager properties are the following:

        - Create Folder
        - Create File
        - Write to File
        - Delete File
        - Delete Folder
        - List Items
        - Exit
